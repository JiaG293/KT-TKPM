Account
a single account in a bank against which transactions can be applied Accounts may be of various types with at least checking and savings A customer can hold more than one account

ATM
a station that allows customers to enter their own transactions using cash cards as identication The ATM interacts with the customer to gather transaction information, sends the transaction information to the central computer for validation and processing and dispenses cash to the customer We assume that an ATM need not operate independently of the network

Bank
a financial institution that holds accounts for customers and that issues cash cards authorizing access to accounts over the ATM network.

Bank computer
the computer owned by a bank that interfaces with the ATM network and the banks own cashier stations A bank may actually have its own internal network of computers to process accounts but we are only concerned with the one that interacts with the network.

Cash Card
a card assigned to a bank customer that authorizes access to accounts using an ATM machine Each card contains a bank code and a card number coded in accordance with national standards on credit cards and cash cards The bank code uniquely identies the bank within the consortium The card number determines the accounts that the card can access A card does not necessarily access all of a customers accounts Each cash card is owned by a single customer but multiple copies of it may exist so the possibility of simultaneous use of the same card from different machines must be considered.

Customer
the holder of one or more accounts in a bank A customer can consist of one or more persons or corporations the correspondence is not relevant to this problem The same person holding an account at a different bank is considered a different customer.

Transaction
a single integral request for operations on the accounts of a single customer We only specied that ATMs must dispense cash but we should not preclude the possibility of printing checks or accepting cash or checks We may also want to provide the flexibility to operate on accounts of different customers although it is not required yet The different operations must balance properly.
